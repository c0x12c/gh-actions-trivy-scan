# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Added the `refresh` input to `terraform-plan` and `terraform-plan-gcp`.
- Changed standalone plan actions to use `-refresh=${{ inputs.refresh }}` with a default of `true`, matching the apply actions.

### Warning

- `v1.1.4` changed AWS `terraform-apply` from always using `-refresh=false` to a configurable `refresh` input with a default of `true`; the GCP apply action also defaults `refresh` to `true` in the current `v1` line. Because `v1` is a moving tag, workflows using `@v1` may have already picked up that behavior. If you need the old no-refresh behavior, set `refresh: 'false'` explicitly or pin to `v1.1.3` while you plan the migration.
- Publish this change as a major release and move consumers to `@v2` once plan/apply refresh behavior is reviewed for each environment.

## [v1.1.7] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Added automated test suite for GitHub Action scripts in `tests/` directory.
- Added a new CI workflow `.github/workflows/test-scripts.yml` to run tests on every pull request and push.

### Fixed

- Fixed backtick escaping logic in `terraform-plan` and `terraform-plan-gcp` actions to correctly handle plans containing backticks by using proper JavaScript escaping.
- Improved the backtick replacement in `terraform-apply-gcp` for consistent PR comment formatting.

### Changed

- Moved existing test scripts from `tools/` to `tests/` for better organization.

## [v1.1.6] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Added `github_token` input parameter to `terraform-apply-gcp` action for posting PR comments.
- Added Terraform Plan step to `terraform-apply-gcp` action to capture plan output before apply.
- Added PR comment posting step to `terraform-apply-gcp` action with deployment results.

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub API "Body is too long" error in `terraform-plan` action by implementing automatic truncation when plan output exceeds 65536 character limit.
- Added fallback minimal message when even truncated plan exceeds GitHub's comment limit.

## [v1.1.5] - 2025-10-05
